# Design and Implementation of Slow and Fast Division Algorithms in Computer Architecture


Description
A division algorithm is a mathematical process that calculates the quotient and/or remainder of two integers, given a dividend and divisor. For example, if the dividend (a) is 15 and the divisor (b) is 8, the quotient (q) is 1 and the remainder (r) is 7. This project aims to implement both slow and fast division algorithms to perform such calculations efficiently.
